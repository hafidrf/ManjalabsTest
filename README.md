# String Validator App

This app is a **String Validator** tool designed to check and validate specific conditions in user input strings. The app determines if a string is "Valid" or "Invalid" based on the frequency of characters, with animated feedback provided on each validation attempt.

## Features
- Splash screen with a smooth loading animation
- Input field for user string entry
- String validation process with "Valid" or "Invalid" status indication
- Animated visual feedback for validation results (green for valid, red for invalid)
- Dynamic, modern UI using Hazy Blue theme for a sleek look and feel

## Technologies Used
- **Kotlin**
- **MVVM Architecture**

## Design Pattern
- **MVVM Architecture**: Utilizes a clear separation between the UI and business logic for better testability and maintainability.
- **Clean Code Principles**: Organized code structure with UseCases, Repository, and Service Layers.
- **Dependency Injection**: Using Koin for flexible and testable components.
